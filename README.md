Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. 
Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.
It usually performs great on many problems, including features with non-linear relationships. Disadvantages, however, include the following: there is no interpretability, overfitting may easily occur, we must choose the number of trees to include in the model.
